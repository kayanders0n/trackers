1. Normalize inputs you’ll validate against
   (trim strings, coalesce simple numerics so later checks see canonical values)

2. Cheap required-field checks
   (NOT NULL/blank, simple booleans/ranges)

3. Cross-row validations (lookups) & business rules
   (EXISTS/joins, ownership checks, conditional requirements)

4. Cosmetic defaults that don’t affect validations
   (e.g., make empty notes '' after you’ve already validated)

5. Generate ID (if insert trigger)
   (last, so you don’t “burn” a sequence if validation fails; move to top only if you log with the new ID in this same trigger)
