Use bulma <button class="delete" /> instead of remove button
Use bulma <div class="notification is-danger> <button class="delete"></button> THIS IS A NOTIFICATION </div> for any alerts to user
Look up bulma icons for additional "notification" or "warning" or "success" or "info" messages (and many other use cases for icons)

=============
TO-DO
=============
[ ] Add Title modal:
    [ ] Submit button needs to add title/series
        [ ] use bulma <div class="notification"> after submit OR error (see above)
    [ ] Bring up Media Modal after Submit
    [ ] I think save and cancel buttons also need to change color
[ ] Media Modal
    [ ] If no file (image) then don't try to display it.
    [ ] include link to website platform (attempt link straight to title)
    [ ] If no series, show "None listed" just like genres shows
[ ] Finish sort order on table
[ ] Add website link to platforms
[ ] Redo navbar

[ ] User log (add users to db, add ability for user to track what movies they watch and when and ratings)

[ ] Media Modal EDITING (suggestion from chatGPT)
    [ ] Approach: Add an Edit button inside the existing title modal. When clicked, it: 
            Replaces display fields with form fields (e.g., genre tags become multi-select, text becomes input fields).
            Shows "Save / Cancel" buttons at the bottom.
        Visual example:
        [ Title:  ██████████████         ]    ⎯ Input field
        [ Type:   ▼ Movie                ]    ⎯ Dropdown
        [ Genres: [x] Drama [x] Comedy   ]    ⎯ Tags with checkboxes
        [ Platforms: ▼ Netflix, Prime    ]    ⎯ Multi-select

        [ Save Changes ]  [ Cancel ]


DATABASE TO-DO:
[ ] CUSTOM AFTER INSERT ON USER TABLE -> ADD DEFAULT LISTS TO USER ACCOUNT WHEN USER IS CREATED
[ ] CUSTOM DELETE ON LIST TABLE -> DON'T ALLOW DEFAULT LISTS TO GET DELETED       

=============
DONE

    [x] Wrapers for series need to work
        [x] remove ALL option from modal media types. Select movie or tv show only.

[x] Clicking on title brings up media modal
[x] Change database to show TITLE instead of ITEM
    [x] Edit all js to show TITLE instead of ITEM
