Use bulma <button class="delete" /> instead of remove button
Use bulma <div class="notification is-danger> <button class="delete"></button> THIS IS A NOTIFICATION </div> for any alerts to user
Look up bulma icons for additional "notification" or "warning" or "success" or "info" messages (and many other use cases for icons)


       

MOVIE PLATFORM TO-DO LIST
==========================

COMPLETED / WORKING
--------------------
[x] Movie insertion (/api/addMovie)
[x] Series selection/insertion (including “New Series” logic)
[x] Platform dropdown loading (/api/platform)
[x] Movie list display (/api/movies)
[x] Platform reordering (drag and drop UI)
[x] Save platforms logic (/api/update-movie-platforms)
[x] Cancel button clears form (clearForm())
[x] Platform table refresh from /api/movie-platforms
[x] Drag handles functional with SortableJS
[x] Removed unused /api/addPlatform route

IN PROGRESS / NEXT STEPS
-------------------------
[ ] Test that platform order persists correctly in the database after saving
[ ] Ensure "Add Platform" duplicate check is working properly (already present in UI)
[ ] Improve user-facing error handling (currently logs to console or uses alert)
[ ] Optional: Add support for editing existing movies
      - UI to select/load a movie
      - Populating the form with movie data
      - Update logic instead of insert
[ ] Optional: Integrate genre functionality into the same tab or as a next feature

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED (OPTIONAL IDEAS)
-------------------------------------
[ ] Additional form validation (e.g., correct date formats, run time logic)
[ ] Standardize how new IDs are returned from insert queries
[ ] Search/filter/sort functionality for the movie list
[ ] Full CRUD for movies or platforms (update/delete)
