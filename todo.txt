Use bulma <button class="delete" /> instead of remove button
Use bulma <div class="notification is-danger> <button class="delete"></button> THIS IS A NOTIFICATION </div> for any alerts to user
Look up bulma icons for additional "notification" or "warning" or "success" or "info" messages (and many other use cases for icons)

=============
TO-DO
=============
[ ] Add Title modal:
    [ ] Submit button needs to add title/series
        [ ] use bulma <div class="notification"> after submit OR error (see above)
    [ ] Bring up Media Modal after Submit
    [ ] Don't forget to make is-series checkbox different color and series dropdown arrow different color
    [ ] I think save and cancel buttons also need to change color
[ ] Media Modal
    [ ] If no file (image) then don't try to display it.
    [ ] include link to website platform (attempt link straight to title)
    [ ] If no series, show "None listed" just like genres shows
[ ] Finish sort order on table
[ ] Add website link to platforms

=============
DONE
=============
[x] Add to genre table ISENTERTAINMENT, ISBOOKS int columns so we can narrow down genre lists
[ ] Add Title modal:
    [x] Media Type dropdown so user can select if movie/tv
    [x] Wrapers for series need to work
        [x] remove ALL option from modal media types. Select movie or tv show only.
[x] Clicking on title brings up media modal
[x] Change database to show TITLE instead of ITEM
    [x] Edit all js to show TITLE instead of ITEM
    [x] Also keep in mind LENGTH was changed to CONTENT_SIZE
    [x] Also check to make sure node-firebird.js and node-firebird-driver-native.js are properly pulling from db
