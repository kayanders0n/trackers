Use bulma <button class="delete" /> instead of remove button
Use bulma <div class="notification is-danger> <button class="delete"></button> THIS IS A NOTIFICATION </div> for any alerts to user
Look up bulma icons for additional "notification" or "warning" or "success" or "info" messages (and many other use cases for icons)
